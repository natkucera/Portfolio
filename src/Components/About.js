              My journey began with a simple desire to understand the magic behind the websites and applications I used daily.
              The initial stages were filled with frustration and countless moments of self-doubt. I often found myself buried
              in error messages, searching tirelessly for solutions and learning from my mistakes. But with each setback, I
              grew more resilient and determined. <br/> <br/>
              With time, my skills improved, and I started to build small projects, applications, and websites that were not only
              functional but also a sources of immense pride. The thrill of creating something from scratch, of seeing an idea 
              come to life through code, was a feeling unlike any other. This journey has taught me not only about programming but 
              also about the power of self-discipline, preserverance, and the boundless possibilities that come with self-directed learning. I've come to appreciate the beauty of 
              problem-solving and the satisfaction of turning lines of code into tangible solutions. <br/><br />
              Today, I continue to explore the ever-evolving world of programming. This website is a reflection of my experiences and the knowledge I've 
              gained and I'm so happy to share it with you! <br/>

            When I'm not at the computer, I love spending time in the kitchen cooking and experimenting with new food<span role="img" aria-label="Food">üç≤</span>. I believe food is an amazing way to connect with others, whether its old friends or new. <br/> 
            Occasionally I will record and share recipes on my TikTok account <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nats_bites?lang=en">@nats_bites</a></span>. <br/><br/>
            Animals have always had a soft spot in my heart. I really enjoy being with my dog Riley<span role="img" aria-label="Dog">üê∂</span> and my bird Ollie<span role="img" aria-label="Bird">üê¶</span>. <br/><br/>
            Travel has always been a big part of my life and I really enjoy seeing and learning about other cultures. <br/><br/>
            When I'm winding down for bed, I love binging on a new (or old) show or reading a good book.
