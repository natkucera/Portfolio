              My journey began with a simple desire to understand the magic behind the websites and applications I used daily.
              The initial stages were filled with frustration and countless moments of self-doubt. I often found myself buried
              in error messages, searching tirelessly for solutions and learning from my mistakes. But with each setback, I
              grew more resilient and determined. <br/> <br/>
              With time, my skills improved, and I started to build small projects, applications, and websites that were not only
              functional but also a sources of immense pride. The thrill of creating something from scratch, of seeing an idea 
              come to life through code, was a feeling unlike any other. This journey has taught me not only about programming but 
              also about the power of self-discipline, preserverance, and the boundless possibilities that come with self-directed learning. I've come to appreciate the beauty of 
              problem-solving and the satisfaction of turning lines of code into tangible solutions. <br/><br />
              Today, I continue to explore the ever-evolving world of programming. This website is a reflection of my experiences and the knowledge I've 
              gained and I'm so happy to share it with you! <br/>

            When I'm not diving into lines of code, you'll often find me in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors and concocting new recipes. <span role="img" aria-label="Food">üç≤</span>
            Cooking isn't just a hobby; it's my creative outlet‚Äîa place where I find joy in blending ingredients much like I do with lines of code. <br/> 
            Occasionally I will record, edit, and share recipes with others on my TikTok account <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nats_bites?lang=en">@nats_bites</a></span>. I love teaching others that
            cooking can be easy and enjoyable. <br/><br/>
            At home, I share my space with two amazing companions. My sassy bird Ollie <span role="img" aria-label="Bird">üê¶</span>, and my sweet dog Riley<span role="img" aria-label="Dog">üê∂</span>, who is always up for an adventure,
            nudging me to step away from the screen and play or go on a nice long walk outdoors. <br/><br/>
            As much as I love crafting digital solutions and unraveling complex problems, I also cherish the simpler moments - 
            savoring a homemade meal, watching a new (or old) show, or catching up with friends. Balancing my passion for technology with these
            delightful facets of life keeps me grounded and fuels my creativity in unexpected ways.
