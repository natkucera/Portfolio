        <p>A little about how I started:</p>
        <p>The pandemic brought harships for me and many others. At the same time, it brought new opportunities for growth.
          After losing my job, I wanted to continue learning and started to program for fun. What started off as a small hobby,
          grew into a real passion that I wanted to take to the next level. I started learning with a mentor who guided me on where to start, while showing me
          the amazing possibilites of programming.</p> 
        <p>I'm excited to show you what I have done so far while I continue to learn and grow.</p>
